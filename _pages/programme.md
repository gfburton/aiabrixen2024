Curated storytelling in/for the digital era: The case of story-formats

My starting point for this talk is that any study of contemporary, everyday life storytelling has to somehow grapple with & factor in the reality of the attested instrumentalization and curation of stories in a range of domains, in particular social media platforms. Following on from this, my aim is to provide a methodologically and analytically replicable framework for studying stories as curated activities, produced out of the entanglements of situated discourses about stories with (technological) affordances of given contexts of storytelling and the participants’ communicative practices. To explore these connections, I will report on my longitudinal study of the evolution of storytelling facilities on social media platforms. I will specifically introduce you to the technographic method I have employed, so as to uncover the processes through which stories become formatted, that is, typified, recognizable and normative activities. I will then tease out the key story-formats that I have documented across platforms and the multi-semiotic features (linguistic, textual, visual, auditory) within them. I will show how the curated formatting of stories results in a templatization of form and content that is replicated across languages and cultures, serving the enregisterment of stories and their tellers as ‘authentic’ and ‘relatable’. I will conclude with reflections on the current, intimate links of storytelling with notions of authenticity, that, although primarily instrumentalized by social media, permeate different contexts of storytelling.

Storying Consumer Experiences: Narrativity in Online Reviews

Online consumer reviews represent a quintessential form of digital business communication, with consumers interacting with multiple audiences comprised of other consumers as well as business. While obligatory components for a digital text to be considered an online consumer review seems to be some balance of description and evaluation of a product, service or experience, there is also a strong tendency for many consumer-authors to rely on narrative structures in the crafting of their review texts (Vasquez, 2014). In this programmatic paper, I explore the questions of when, where, how, and for what purposes online review authors adopt a narrative structure. I engage with issues of how various multimodal digital affordances interact with narrativity, and I consider a range of digital reviews and review-like texts. From more prototypical, chronologically structured reviews appearing on dedicated review platforms (Vasquez, 2015), to reviewing activities found in other social media fora (Reddit), to newer, multimodal reviewing genres appearing on video sharing sites (YouTube, Tiktok), I argue that although reviewing genres seem to be evolving to become increasingly more hybrid, reviewers continue to rely on a range of narrative practices in the service of producing an compelling digital self, of connecting with their audience, and of organizing their content as they story their consumer experiences. I call for greater attention to the multimodal features that accompany narrative practices in online consumer reviews.
