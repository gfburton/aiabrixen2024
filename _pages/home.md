## Welcome!

The 2024 AIA seminar, "A Linguistic Lens on Narratives in Professional Settings", will take place at the Faculty of Education, Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, from 16th to 18th May 2024. We welcome contributions on English-language narratives in professional settings from different research areas and disciplines from PhD students and emerging scholars from a range of theoretical and methodological approaches (e.g. conversation analysis, discourse analysis, critical discourse analysis, genre analysis, corpus linguistics, contrastive linguistics, cognitive linguistics, and ethnography of communication).
