**Location**

The seminar will take place at the [Faculty of Education, Brixen-Bressanone](https://www.unibz.it/en/applicants/the-three-campuses/brixen-bressanone/).

The full address is:

[Regensburger Allee 16 - viale Ratisbona, 16
Italy - 39042, Brixen-Bressanone](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3nkBUX4geAmBePMr9)

The faculty is within walking distance from Bressanone train station. The nearest airports are in Innsbruck, Munich, Verona, Milan and Venice.

There are direct train links (no need to change train) from Innsbruck, Munich and Verona. Travelling from elsewhere in Italy by train, most tickets can be booked on the [Trenitalia site](https://www.trenitalia.com). If you plan to travel with the Trenord/ÖBB trains, it is worth booking in advance as the tickets are often discounted. Different discounts for these trains can also be found by booking on [bahn.de](https://www.bahn.de) and at [tickets.oebb.at](https://tickets.oebb.at). [Italo trains](https://www.italotreno.it) arrive as far as Bolzano, and may offer better value or be at more convenient times than Trenitalia trains. They do not appear on the timetable shown on the Trenitalia site.

It is also possible to arrive in Bressanone with [Flixbus](https://www.flixbus.it).

**About the campus and Brixen-Bressanon**

Since the end of the World War II Brixen-Bressanone has experienced a spurt in economic growth while consolidating its artistic and cultural vocation. Visitors will find a comfortably-sized town of about 18,000 inhabitants, free of traffic problems.

The mediaeval alleys and the wealth of historical references are an ideal starting point for excursions into the countryside and for practising a whole variety of sports and leisure activities. It is possible to set off by bike or on foot for excursions into the surrounding hills and mountains; a good example of a fine place for walking and biking is the Plose mountain, easily accessible by public transport, and which in the winter months becomes a favourite area for skiing and snowboarding.

The Faculty of Education and the annexed University Library is housed in the modern university complex in the very centre of the town.
